gameState is a work-in-progess app I created with React and Firebase to search for videogames and save them two one of two lists: games I've played and games I want to play. This was a great experience in managing state across multiple components and using both Firebase authentication and realtime storage, all with a mobile first design. 

Features included: 
- search for games on all platforms (data provided by RAWG API)
- save to a list: Games Played or Games to Play
- Insert extra info to games saved to games played list: Date played, comments, status (playing, beat, dropped)
- sync lists across devices with account
- screenshots gallery for games saved in games played list

Features being worked on: 
- desktop version
- edit games in played games list
- sorting, view options for lists
