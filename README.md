gameState is a work-in-progess app I created with React and Firebase to search for videogames and save them two one of two lists: games I've played and games I want to play. For now it is in a minimum viable product state with more features being worked on. 

This was a great experience in managing state across multiple components and using both Firebase authentication and realtime storage, all with a mobile first design (desktop version coming soon).
